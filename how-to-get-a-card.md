## Getting a Medical Cannabis Card is a 3-step process:

*Step One:* determine that you (or someone close to you) qualify  
*Step Two:* find a doctor to sign your recommendation  
*Step Three:* fill out the applications

### Step One: Qualify
* You must be an Illinois resident
* You may not have been convicted of a felony drug crime or violent crime.
* You (or someone close to you) must have a qualifying medical condition.  A complete list of these conditions is on the Conditions page.

### Step Two: Make sure your physician will recommend cannabis.
If your physician has concerns about recommending cannabis, or simply refuses, please reach out to us and we will help. Anyone with a qualifying diagnosis in their medical records will be able to find a physician to certify them for the program.

> **Optional Step: Assign a Caregiver**   
> While not required, we __strongly recommend that patients assign a caregiver.__  A caregiver has all of the privileges of purchasing and possessing cannabis as a patient, and is designated by a patient to help purchase and cannabis on their behalf. If you are close to someone who qualifies, we encourage you to discuss their becoming a patient and assigning you as their caregiver.

### Step Three: Apply.
You will also need to get your fingerprints taken, which we can do without appointment.  Just call ahead of time to make sure our fingerprint tech is on site.

### Costs
The application fee is $100, except for those on need-based assistance, who pay a $50 fee.  Fingerprints usually cost $55-$65; however, D33 charges $50, which is then refunded back to the patient upon their first purchase after receiving their cannabis card.  Caregivers are required to pay the same fingerprint cost as well as a $25 application fee.  The only other costs to apply are for the doctor visits, which are usually covered by insurance. 

### Veterans
For veterans receiving care from a Veterans Affairs facility, rather than a physician recommendation form you will need to request VA Form 10-5345 to authorize the release of your medical records, and VA Form DD214 to certify character and dates of service. 

### Minors
All qualifying conditions apply to minors as well, but their applications must be completed by a parent or legal guardian.  The only other difference is that in addition to a physician signing the minor’s medical cannabis recommendation form, a second physician is required to sign a reviewing physician form. 

The Parent or Guardian of a qualifying minor will have to fill out the
[Application for Minors]({{ site.github.url }}/documents/Minor-Application.pdf)
and will also need a to acquire a second, reviewing physician’s approval. Go to
the Forms Page for the complete set and reach out to us with any questions.
