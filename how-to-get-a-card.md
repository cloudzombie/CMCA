Applying to become a patient or caregiver in the Illinois Medical Cannabis
Pilot Program is a multi-step process: first, determine that you qualify;
second, make sure your doctor will recommend you for the program; and third,
fill out the application.  It’s a little complicated, but we’re here to help –
by email, by phone or in person.

1. Determine that you qualify
    1. You must be an Illinois resident
    2. You may not have been convicted of a felony drug crime or violent crime.
    3. You must have a qualifying medical condition.
2. Make sure your physician will recommend you. If your physician has concerns
about recommending cannabis or simply refuses reach out to us and we will help.
3. Apply:
    1. Get the Application: either download a [paper copy]({{ site.github.url }}/documents/Patient-Application.pdf)
    to mail in or [apply online](https://medicalcannabispatients.illinois.gov/).
    2. Decide if you want a Caregiver.  A caregiver is someone designated by a
    patient to purchase cannabis either with the patient or on their behalf.  
    Caregivers can accompany patients inside the retail area of the dispensary
    or come alone without the patient.  Regardless, caregivers have all of the
    privileges of purchasing and possessing cannabis as patients do.  In order
    to qualify, caregivers must:
        1. Be at least 21 years old
        2. Not have been convicted of a felony drug crime or violent crime
        3. May only serve this role for a single patient
        4. If you do want a Caregiver, then fill in your caregiver’s
        information on your application and have them complete the
        [Application for a Designated Caregiver Registry Identification Card]({{ site.github.url }}/documents/Caregiver-Registration.pdf).
    3. Complete the [Fingerprint Consent Form]({{ site.github.url }}/documents/Fingerprint-Consent-Form.pdf)
    and have a Livescan vendor take your fingerprints.  Fingerprinting can be
    performed at Dispensary 33 by appointment.
    4. Have your physician complete the [Physician Written Certification Form]({{ site.github.url }}/documents/Physician-Certification.pdf).
    Your physician, rather than you, must submit this document directly to the State.  

## For Veterans
If you are a veteran receiving care from a Veterans Affairs facility, rather than
a physician recommendation form you will need to request VA Form 10-5345, to
authorize the release of your medical records, and VA Form DD214 to certify
character and dates of service.

## For Minors
The Parent or Guardian of a qualifying minor will have to fill out the
[Application for Minors]({{ site.github.url }}/documents/Minor-Application.pdf)
and will also need a to acquire a second, reviewing physician’s approval. Go to
the Forms Page for the complete set and reach out to us with any questions.

## About Cannabis
While we question the validity of the decades long “War on Drugs” and attempt
to view policy through the lens of public health concerns, we find that what has
been lacking is scientific research and a compassionate approach.

Today however, new research concerning the possible benefits of cannabis is
altering the discussion. It is nearly impossible to ignore the fact that the
rhetoric demonizing cannabis was grossly overstated. Polling indicates that more
than 40% of Americans have used cannabis. That’s a large number of people who have
personal experience. These people are your family and friends and neighbors.
They are lawyers and doctors and parents. At best, we know someone who has
benefitted greatly from using cannabis.

A person who could alleviate pain without, or with fewer, prescription painkillers.
A person who could regain their appetite after undergoing chemotherapy.
A child who could reduce seizure occurrences. Anecdotal cases demand further
research. We are far from drawing absolute conclusions.However, we must weigh
any possible negative side effects of cannabis use against its many, many potential
benefits. The great shift occurring now is motivated by the desire to side with
the patient’s wishes.

We know there is a lot of information to sift through. That’s why our opinions are
always guided by patient experience and the best research available. We spend a
lot of time reading papers and vetting them for credibility. We don’t get our
knowledge from random web articles and neither should you.

## Program FAQs
Illinois was the 23rd state to pass legislation legalizing the use of cannabis to
treat certain medical conditions. Every state has different rules that govern
medical cannabis use and the rules here are different than other states, even
ones that only allow medical and not recreational use.

#### DO I NEED A PRESCRIPTION FROM MY DOCTOR?
Doctors can’t actually prescribe cannabis in the US, but they can recommend it to their patients.
Your doctor will need to fill out a [Physician Certification Form]({{ site.github.url }}/documents/Physician-Certification.pdf)
and send it, themselves, to the State. This form essentially states that you have one of the Debilitating Medical Conditions
and that the doctor recommends cannabis for you.

#### I HAVE A CONDITION THAT’S NOT ON THE LIST, BUT MY DOCTOR THINKS MEDICAL CANNABIS WOULD HELP. CAN I STILL QUALIFY?
Unfortunately, no. Only people with one or more of the approved conditions can qualify.
However, there is a process (albeit a slow one) by which the State can be petitioned to add conditions.
The application to add a Condition is at the bottom of the [Forms]({{ site.github.url }}/forms) page.

#### CAN SOMEONE UNDER 18 QUALIFY?
Yes, but there is a different application form that the patient’s legal guardian must fill out and,
in addition to the doctor’s recommendation form, a second doctor must fill out a reviewing doctor’s
certification form.

#### IF MY DOCTOR WON’T SIGN OFF ON MY FORM, CAN’T I JUST GO TO A “WEED DOCTOR” WHO WILL?
Other states may have doctors who offer services that cater to patients specifically
seeking to use medical cannabis, but the laws In Illinois are meant to keep that from
happening here. You can’t just see a doctor for a single visit and get your recommendation
signed. You have to be in that doctor’s “continuing care”. However, you are free to
have multiple doctors; only one of them would need to agree to sign off on allowing you
access to cannabis treatment.  If you are having difficulty finding a doctor, please contact us.

#### CAN I GROW MY OWN CANNABIS?
No. Illinois does not allow any persons to grow cannabis. Only the licensed Cultivation Centers can grow.

#### WHERE CAN I PURCHASE MEDICAL CANNABIS?
Patients may only purchase from among state-licensed dispensaries.  In addition, patients
have to be pre-registered at one particular dispensary of their choosing and can only
buy at that specific location.  Patients may change dispensaries as often as they like
and are not charged to do so; each change should take 1-2 business days.  The dispensary
selection form to change dispensaries can be found at our [Forms]({{ site.github.url }}/forms) page.

#### HOW MUCH MEDICAL CANNABIS CAN I PURCHASE?
By default, patients are allowed to purchase up to 2.5 oz. of cannabis in any 2-week period.
However, physicians are allowed to recommend a higher allowance – in our experience,
we have seen patients with twice, and sometimes triple, the regular allowance.  
Even if a patient is originally allowed only 2.5oz, a physician may increase this
amount by resubmitting a portion of the Physician Certification Form without any
additional fees to the patient.

For concentrates and edibles, the cannabis allotments are determined by how much
cannabis was used to make them. Every product will have this amount registered
into the computer system to keep track.

#### WHERE CAN I LEGALLY USE MEDICAL CANNABIS?
Essentially, you can only medicate in private, because patients cannot use cannabis in:
* Any public place, including anywhere other people can see.
* Any government building
* Any school or daycare or school bus

#### WHAT ABOUT IN MY CAR?
You can’t use cannabis in your car or operate a motor vehicle, aircraft or boat
while under the influence. Patients can possess cannabis in their car, as
long as it is in a sealed, tamper-evident container.

#### CAN I GIVE SOMEONE CANNABIS IF THEY’RE A PATIENT TOO?
No. You can’t give or sell anyone else cannabis, even if they are a registered patient.

#### DOES ILLINOIS ALLOW CAREGIVERS?
Yes. In Illinois, patients can designate a caregiver to purchase cannabis products
from dispensaries on their behalf. Patients may only have one designated caregiver
at any time and caregivers may only serve one patient at any time. Requirements
for caregivers are that the must:
* be at least 21 years old
* be a resident of Illinois
* not have been convicted of an excluded offense
Caregivers have to apply for registration with the Department of Public Heath.
It’s a separate form, and it’s on our [Forms]({{ site.github.url }}/forms) page.
